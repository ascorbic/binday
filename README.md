# Binday
This page is about the binday project, which is currently assembling data on waste and recycling collection days for all authorities in the UK. Currently the project is in development, but when the data is more complete it will be released in a standard format, as open data under the Open Government Licence. There will also be a free API to enable developers to create apps and services to encourage recycling.

## Information for authorities
You may have been directed to this site because you have received an FOI request for waste collection data. This site will try to answer any questions you may have, and help you to respond to the request.

### Why are you sending me this request?
I am sending similar requests to every authority in the UK. There is no central source of this data, which means that apps or services to find collection days only work for a single authority. This means that many of the most useful services are not viable. By assembling a national dataset I am hoping to make it possible to create apps and services that work for the whole country.

### You can find out collection days on the authority website
I understand that most authorities have a website where residents can search for their colleciton day. This doesn't help in creating apps, as these are mostly only viable if they work for the whole country. An app or web service needs access to the raw data. The waste collection information is a dataset, so section 11 and 11A FOIA states that it must be released in a re-usable format under an open licence. A web link is not a reusable format.

### We don't hold the data in the requested format / it would cost us too much to retrieve it
Most authorities have a web service where collection days can be searched by address. This service will be powered by a database, which will hold all of the data required. All database systems can export a CSV file. The FTT has ruled that creating a report or query doesn't count as creating new data for the purposes of FOI.

### The data is held by our waste contractor, not by the authority
The ICO has stated that information held by a contractor on behalf of an authority is treated as being held by the authority for the purpose of FOI.

### The data is commercially sensitive information
I am only requesting the same data available on the authority website. I am just requesting it in an easily accessible, reusable format. As the data is publicly available, no common law duty of confidence applies.

### We don't hold the data by address, just by street or postcode.
That's fine. I am happy to receive the street or postcode level data.

### It is impractical for us to assemble the data for all properties in multi-occupancy blocks.
That's fine. Just send it by parent address.

### We cannot supply the data, as it is copyright Ordnance Survey or Royal Mail
The waste collection data was created by the authority as part of its public task, and no third party copyright applies. If the address data was created by the authority then it also belongs to the authority. I am happy for you to exclude postcode data. Ordnance Survey has stated that UPRNs can be released as open data.

### The address data was sourced from AddressBase / PAF / NLPG
I hold an AddressBase licence, so you can release the data to me. If this is the situation, I request that you release the data in two parts. First the colletion data and UPRNs, which should be sent to the WhatDoTheyKnow email address associated with the request. As required by Section 11 and 11A FOIA, and the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations, this should be released as open data - ideally licenced under the Open Government Licence. The second version of the data, including addresses and postcodes,can be sent to me dirctly by email. Please contact me via the WhatDoTheyKnow address and I will tell you the email address to use. Ordnance Survey have released a statement regarding this request, which is quoted below. If you have any queries about this, please contact the OS PSMA helpdesk. 

### We will release the data, but you must not use it for commercial purposes or release it to anyone else.
While I am not plannign to use the data for commercial purposes, I need it to be released under an open licence so that I can release the whole dataset as open data. The Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations state that datasets created by an authority should be released under the most open licence possible, ideally the Open Government Licence (OGL). There are only limited cases where a more restrictive licence may be used. If the dataset includes third party copyright such as postcodes that please just release the authority-owned data under the OGL.


## Statement from Ordnance Survey regarding the waste collection data requests
_Further to our statement issued on 28 July 2017 in relation to the FOI request for waste and recycling collection dates, we have now been in discussion with the requester, and are pleased to confirm that we have reached an agreed licensing position in relation to Ordnance Survey and Royal Mail intellectual property (IPR) in the address details._
 
_For address information which is not Authority Owned Data as defined by your DCA (the Data Co-operation Agreement between each local authority and GeoPlace) or the UPRN, we are happy for local authorities to supply this information to the requester, provided that you state that his use of the data is subject to the terms to be agreed between him and Ordnance Survey.  These terms will enable him to achieve his stated aims, but since the terms will not permit the requester to make all the information freely available on the internet, we have agreed with him that this address information will not be provided via the whatdotheyknow route._
 
_Therefore, if you have address information which you are happy to disclose to the requester via a means other than the whatdotheyknow route, provided that his use of the data is subject to the terms agreed between him and Ordnance Survey, please notify the requester in the response and ask him to provide you with a different email address so that you can send the data to him._
 
_In relation to (a) waste/recycling collection days, (b) the UPRN, and (c) Authority Owned Data 1 (for further detail on this, please see footnote below), of course, there is no issue from either Ordnance Survey’s or Royal Mail’s perspective with local authorities providing this information to the requester in response to the FOI request (whether via the whatdotheyknow e-mail address or to the email address given above)._

_Footnote:
1 It is not possible for Ordnance Survey to advise individual local authorities as to which of its address information  is Authority Owned Data ; this is a decision for each local authority to make, i.e. the local authority would need to be confident that it has created new house names, numbers, street names and localities without any reference to address data licensed through the PSMA Member Licence (or a previous agreement).  Having said that, our assumption would be that to the extent that the address information is  taken from a local authority’s LLPG, such addresses will not be Authority Owned Data – note that the DCA and the PSMA Member Licence were drafted on this basis, see for example Recital D i) from the DCA, which provides that the licensing of Address datasets via the PSMA Member Licence enables licensed use of the LLPGs._
 
_The position in Scotland is slightly different, but the same position applies to addresses held by Scottish local authorities, and again the OSMA Member Licence enables use of each local authority’s Corporate Address Gazetteer, to the extent it has been created or maintained using Ordnance Survey address data._
